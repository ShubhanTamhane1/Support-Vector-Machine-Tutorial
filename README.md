# SVM Digit Classifier - Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)

This project demonstrates the use of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify handwritten digits **4** and **9** from the [MNIST dataset](https://www.openml.org/d/554). This was created as part of a presentation for my **Intro to Data Science** course. The presentation is also included. 

## What I Did

- Implemented a Support Vector Machine classifier using **Pythonâ€™s scikit-learn** library
- Used the **MNIST dataset**, which contains 70,000 handwritten digit images (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing)
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Trained the classifier and evaluated its performance
- Prepared a **set of slides and notes** (written in Quarto) to aid in understanding the algorithm 

## Summary of Results

| Metric | Score |
|---------|---------|
| Accuracy |  0.994 |
| Precision (label = 9) |  0.992 |
| F1 Score (label = 9) |  0.994 |
